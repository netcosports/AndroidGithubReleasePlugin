AndroidGithubReleasePlugin
=====
The android github release plugin is a gradle plugin that works along side with the android gradle plugin to create github releases, and upload build outputs to the new release.

The DSL is designed to mimic the android build plugin DSL for type and flavor configuration. 
   
Installation & Usage
--------------------
The plugin is now hosted on the [Gradle Plugin Portal](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.trevjonez.AndroidGithubReleasePlugin): 
```groovy
buildscript {
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.netcosports:github-release:1.1.0'
    } 
}
```

In the app or library module apply and configure the plugin as desired
```groovy
apply plugin: 'github-release-plugin'

GithubApi {
  owner "RepoOwner"
  repo "RepoName"
  authToken GITHUB_API_TOKEN
}

AndroidGithubRelease {
  defaultConfig {
    tagName "1.0.0"
    assets 'build/outputs'
  }

  androidConfigs {
    debug {
      preRelease true
      tagModifier { it + "-DEBUG" } // "1.0.0-DEBUG"
    }
    release {
      draft true
      releaseName "Release Name Here"
    }
  }
}
```

The [`GithubApi`](https://github.com/trevjonez/github-api) block exposes top level configuration which is used as a convention input to the tasks registered by this plugin.
- apiUrl(String) default: `https://api.github.com`, base url for github api
- owner(String) **required**, username or organization name
- repo(String) **required**, name of the repository
- authToken(String) **required**, key requires `repo` permission


The `defaultConfig` block as well as the named blocks have the following api options
- tagName(String) **required**, name of new or existing tag
- targetCommitish(String) default: `master`, see [github api docs](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#create-a-release) for details
- releaseName(String) _optional_, release title
- releasebody(String) _optional_, body content of release
- draft(boolean) default: `false`, flags the github release as a draft
- preRelease(boolean) default: `false`, flags the github release as a pre-release
- overwrite(boolean) default: `false`, allows release meta data to be updated, existing binaries must be manually deleted prior to re-upload
- tagModifier(Transformer<String, String>) _optional_, transformer for dynamic tag naming based on combined configuration
- assets(String vararg) _optional_, file or directory names relative to module directory, Any `asset` that is a directory will be zipped before being uploaded

### Advanced Config
For builds with flavors the named blocks are applied in a cascading override manner:
```groovy
AndroidGithubRelease {
  defaultConfig {
    tagName "A"
  }

  androidConfigs {
    debug {
      tagName "B"
    }
    release {
      ...
    }
    
    red {
      tagName "C"
    }
    blue {
      ...
    }
    
    redDebug {
      tagName "D"
    }
  }
}
```

The cascade order is `flavor(s)`->`type`->`fullVariantName`.
Following this ordering the above configs associated `createRedDebugGithubRelease` task would create a tag named "D", `createRedReleaseGithubRelease` would be "C", `createBlueDebugGithubRelease` would be "B", `createBlueReleaseGithubRelease` would be "A"

In a multi dimensional build the flavors are cascaded in the same order as listed in the variant name.

There are two exceptions to the cascading override:
 1. `tagModifier` string transformers which are applied in the cascade order
 2. `assets` do not override but are combined into a set

Tasks
-----
Each build variant will create a `createFlavorTypeGithubRelease` task which creates/updates the github release

Each asset to upload will create a task named `uploadFlavorTypeAsset0`...`uploadFlavorTypeAssetN`
All numbered upload asset tasks depend on the create release task,

Each build variant also creates a `uploadFlavorTypeAssets` task which functionally does nothing however the task automatically depends on all upload asset tasks. This serves to provide a clean hook point for making other tasks depend on the success of the github release tasks

Running project tests
-------
In order to run tests you must first create a repository to test against on github and update the three test cases configs to point at that test repo.
From that point you create a `local.properties` file in `src/test/resources` and add the `GITHUB_API_TOKEN` as well as the normal `sdk.dir` property.
